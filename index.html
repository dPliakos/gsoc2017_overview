    <p id="abstract">
      <h4> Abstract </h4>
      Treematcher is a subproject of ete3. Target of treematcher is to perform search
      to phylogenetic trees using tree patterns that allows relax connection between
      tree nodes in newick format mimicking the regular expressions' functionality.
    </p>

    <p id="targets">
      <h4> Targets: </h4>
      <ul>
        <li> Have the ability to use regular expressions' symbols (metacharacters) and functionality to describe a pattern</li>
        <li> Allow treematcher's pattern describe loose connection between nodes </li>
        <li> Allow treematcher's pattern describe patterns in a node's descendants </li>
        <li> Treematcher's patterns describe attributes to so test the presence of conditions in a tree nodes </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p id="background">
      <h4> Background </h4>
      Treematcher is not a new project. The base code was already written the time GSoC started
      and that code was used to extend it's functionality. The treematcher could match patterns
      that wheren't use metacharacters and could skip nodes using the "one or more" (intermediate nodes)
      between two nodes functionality ( the + sumbol).
    </p>

    <h4> Coding periods </h4>

    <p id="period1">
      <h4> First Coding Period </h4>

      So in the first coding period the was about understaning the logic and the approach
      of the problem and defining how treematcher will adopt regular expressions' functionality.
      <br />
      That time was about the relax connection between the nodes.
      The basic symbols' functionality was implemented (like *, +, ^, $).
      <br/>
      At late first period the implementation logic changed and insted of treating every
      metacharacter indipendently, they where categorized in cases.
    </p>

    <p id="period2">
      <h4> Second Coding Period </h4>
      In the second coding period the rest of the symbols and some sets where implemented.
      That was done quickly thanks to the new technique that was introduced.
      <br/>
      The use of purly python expressions to define a node gave the ability for
      more complex patterns to be expressed like numerical comparisons between sets or the whole tree.<br/>
      In the second coding period the ability to describe a pattern about a node's descendants using metacharacters
      was introduced and proved that the existing algorithm could not satisfy the treematcher needs. <br/>
      That is an usefull ability that treeematcher should have, so after a long
      debugging time of the approaches that were tried, the dessision to refactor the code was made and started.
    </p>

    <p id="period3">
      <h4> Third coding period </h4>
      During the third coding period the code was refactored quickly thanks to
      mentrors' effort, the experience that where gained and the techniques that where learnt. <br/>
      Before the refactoring the focus was on patterns that describe a tree's
      topology, but after the refactor the focus is on nodes' descendants patterns
      resulting the loss of a lot of functionality. <br/>
      The new approach differs a lot in both implementation and logic to describe
      the patterns. <br/>
      That time the command line toolkit was updated and extended. <br/>
      Treematcher's preperation for mering to it's parent project (ete3) was made
      and documentation was updated.
    </p>

    <p id="parts">
      <h4> Interesting parts </h4>
      <ul>
        <li> The catigorization of metacharacters (period 1) </li>
        <li> The ability to use pure python expressions to define a node (period 2) </li>
        <li> Limitations are met at describing nodes' descendants relax patterns (period2) </li>
        <li> The code reefactoring (period 3) </li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <p id="conclusion">
      <h4> Conclusion </h4>
      What is done <br>
      Treematcher is able to describe relax connection between nodes. <br/>
      Treematcher is able to describe relax  patterns at a node's descendants. <br/>
      Treematcher is able to test complex patterns using node's attributes. <br/>

      <br/>
      What is left to do <br/>

        .... TO BE FILLED ...

      <br/><br/>
      Treematcher seems to satisfy a lot of the tergets that where set. <br/>
      A lot of the student's code is not merged, but was used to find the limitations
      of the approach or the techniques was extracted to meet the refactoring needs.
